# javascript-intro-workshop

Material for a workshop I taught for beginner javascript devs.

This goes with a slidedeck I have on getting started with javascript.

After a brief overview of javascript syntax, we create an index.html with code to serve and a Pomadoro timer and the customizations are to add features. 

We customize the project according to it what the students preferred to work on next, those features are in branches.


Branches: 

* fancy timer, shows count of pomadoros complete along with the times you had to stop (interruptions)
* show status, shows a nice window of what the current state is
